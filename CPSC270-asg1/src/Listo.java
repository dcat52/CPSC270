/**
 * <p>
 * List class ADT of Objects.

 * <p>
 * The purpose of this exercise is to give you practice with pointers and linked
 * lists. If you just google and copy/paste/modify, you might get it to work,
 * but you will not benefit from the exercise. You will likely not be able to
 * answer questions about this on the Final.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This list has a cursor that indicates the current element. When a Listo is
 * instantiated, it is empty (it contains no elements). It is somewhat similar
 * to the List interface of our book, but there are significant differences. You
 * will not be able to just copy and paste the book's implementation. Please
 * read the method descriptions carefully. Post questions on piazza as soon as
 * you think of them. Remember that you can ask concept questions but you may
 * not share or examine code that is not your own.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <em>
 * NOTE: This is DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK.
 * </em>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this interface is up to you and your creativity, as
 * long as you use linked lists. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <em>Note however that your implementation MUST BE NAMED LListo.</em>
